# Heuristic Evaluation: Team 70, Evaluating Team 71

# Plan

We chose to perform a heuristic evaluation. We considered this a stronger option than a cognitive walkthrough because this app has many different functions rather than a single primary path that most users will take through it. Choosing to perform a heuristic evaluation enabled us to better study the overall interactivity and design of the program as a whole, rather than as a series of tasks with significant overlap (and, therefore, duplication of effort).

We opted to use the Norman-Nielsen criteria, as they were developed and are used by the experts. These are:

1. Visibility of system status
2. Match between system and the real world
3. User control and freedom
4. Consistency and standards
5. Error prevention
6. Recognition rather than recall
7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
9. Helps user recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
10. Help and documentation

We individually attempted to use Team 71's application with these criteria in mind. We hoped that this process would surface any serious usability issues that users of this application would face. As a group, we compiled a list of usability issues that we encountered.

We rated these issues on a 1-4 scale reflecting their frequency and importance to user experience. On this scale:

1 indicates a minor issue; it occurs infrequently and, when it does occur, poses only a minor difficulty in interacting with the program.

2 indicates a more serious, but not crippling, issue with the interface; it may occur frequently or infrequently, but represents a significant difficulty in successfully interacting with the program.

3 indicates a serious issue that occurs frequently (posing a significant annoyance), or a crippling (to the point of requiring complex or unintuitive workarounds, if any exist), but more infrequent issue.

4 indicates an issue that is both crippling and frequent. Type 4 issues make the user consider just giving up.

# Execute

Working individually, we compiled lists of usability bugs encountered while using the program.

### Dan Theriault

Welcome screen does not convey app identity (1)

The inconsistent button sizes on the home screen are distracting. Center alignment makes this worse (1)

The application describes itself as a water reporting system, which does not accurate describe the breadth of functionality (1)

Submitting reports fails if you have not set up your profile, and this requirement is not well-indicated. You should include a profile setup page in registration, or at least throw an informative error message up (4)

Not all screens have headers / titles, and this can make it hard to keep your place in the application (3)

I had difficulty zooming on the map. There are no buttons shown to do so, and there was no signifier that double-clicking would zoom in. (2)

The position of the "back to application" button is inconsistent (2)

Depending on the color of the map, the "back to application" button can be difficult to see (1)

### Ivan

Source reports don't save across accounts (3)

### Aaron

On main application page all buttons are in verb form except for "source reports" and "purity reports" (2)

On Report Water Purity page the cancel button text is cut off (1)

On Report Water Source Page, View Water Source Page, and View Water Purity Page there is no header so it is confusing about what page you are on. (2)

### Amethyst Sanders

Welcome: no app name, no description. 2

View All Reports: different back to application button 1

Profile: needs edited before report can be made, but this is not stated before trying to make the report 4

When Adding a Report: says cancel instead of back to application. Either could work. 1

Purity Reports: acts like there are 4 default reports, but they are not real 3

Source Reports: added reports do not show on other user accounts 3

Edit Profile: after updated the title and the email text  get swapped if you go back to the page 4

Map: slow to update 1

Help: not really helpful 1
