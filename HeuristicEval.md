# Heuristic Evaluation: Team 70, Evaluating Team 71

# Plan

We chose to perform a heuristic evaluation. We considered this a stronger option than a cognitive walkthrough because this app has many different functions rather than a single primary path that most users will take through it. Choosing to perform a heuristic evaluation enabled us to better study the overall interactivity and design of the program as a whole, rather than as a series of tasks with significant overlap (and, therefore, duplication of effort).

We opted to use the Norman-Nielsen criteria, as they were developed and are used by the experts. These are:

1. Visibility of system status
2. Match between system and the real world
3. User control and freedom
4. Consistency and standards
5. Error prevention
6. Recognition rather than recall
7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
9. Helps user recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
10. Help and documentation

We individually attempted to use Team 71's application with these criteria in mind. We hoped that this process would surface any serious usability issues that users of this application would face. As a group, we compiled a list of usability issues that we encountered.

We rated these issues on a 1-4 scale reflecting their frequency and importance to user experience. On this scale:

1 indicates a minor issue; it occurs infrequently and, when it does occur, poses only a minor difficulty in interacting with the program.

2 indicates a more serious, but not crippling, issue with the interface; it may occur frequently or infrequently, but represents a significant difficulty in successfully interacting with the program.

3 indicates a serious issue that occurs frequently (posing a significant annoyance), or a crippling (to the point of requiring complex or unintuitive workarounds, if any exist), but more infrequent issue.

4 indicates an issue that is both crippling and frequent. Type 4 issues make the user consider just giving up.

# Execute

Working individually, we compiled lists of usability bugs encountered while using the program.
